### About ME 

![image-right]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ning1.jpg){: .align-right}

Hello everyone, I am Xin Ning. You can also call me Sabrina. I earned my Ph.D. in Applied Economics in 2019 from Virginia Tech and currently work as a postdoc researcher at the Center for Agricultural Trade, VT. My research includes international trade issues, agricultural and food policy evaluation, and other topics in applied economics. My industry interests include market analysis, user acquisition and conversion, experiment design and A/B testing, and practical applications using machine learning and statistical modelling. Here is my [resume](https://xning11.github.io/files/Xin_Ning_Resume.pdf).

I enjoy applying the cutting-edge methodologies to do quantitative and qualitative analysis that delivers insightful results to policy- and decision-makers. I made this personal website - **Learn Unknown** - to track my learning journey of economics, statistics, mathematics, machine learning algorithms, and relevant techniques used in both applied econ and data science arena, and to share useful thoughts and resources for potential beneficients. If you'd like to join this journey, please feel free to reach out.
