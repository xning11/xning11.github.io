### About ME 

![image-right]({{ site.url }}/images/ning1.jpg){: .align-right}

Hello everyone, I am Xin (pronounced as *shinn*). You can also call me Sabrina. I earned my Ph.D. in Economics in 2019 from Virginia Tech and currently work as a postdoc researcher at the Center for Agricultural Trade in VT. My research areas include international trade, agricultural and food policy evaluation, and other topics in applied economics. I enjoy applying the state-of-the-art methodologies to do quantitative analysis that provides insightful suggestions to policy- and decision-making. Thus, I decide to make this personal website - **Learn Unknown** - to track my learning journey of economics, statistics, mathematics, machine learning algorithms, and relevant techniques used in data science arena, and to share useful thoughts and resources for potential beneficients. If you'd like to join this journey, please feel free to reach out.
